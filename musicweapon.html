  <h1>When Music Becomes a Weapon: A Journalist's Reflection on Ethical Boundaries in Art</h1>
  <p><strong>By billund & Evan Bei </strong></p>

  <p>In the wake of recent armed confrontations between Israel and Iran, a disturbing phenomenon has re-emerged online: the use of newly written music and music videos as tools to mock, incite, or denigrate one side of a conflict—sometimes even going as far as to target specific religious beliefs.</p>

  <p>As a songwriter, I find this trend not only deeply irresponsible but also dangerous. Satirical or propagandistic songs that glorify one side while ridiculing the other—especially during active warfare—do not serve peace or justice. They distort the very purpose of music.</p>

  <p>Music, though often described as “borderless,” must not be without ethical boundaries. It is a human creation with the power to heal, to unite, and to elevate the spirit. To use it instead as a weapon—through nationalistic aggression, religious mockery, or thinly veiled hate speech—is a betrayal of its essence.</p>

  <p>We, as artists, must remember: music is not a tool for killing. It is a voice for remembering, for resisting violence, and for calling humanity back from the brink.</p>

  <p>In my own work, I strive to reflect this responsibility. In my upcoming release <strong>WHERE SHE WAS</strong> (to be published on June 27), the song <em>She in the Fires of War</em> addresses the devastation of conflict from a human, nonpartisan perspective. One of its central verses reads:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "No man should take a life,<br>
    Even dressed in iron pride.<br>
    History weeps in stone —<br>
    When shall we meet again?"
  </blockquote>

  <p>This lyric, translated into multiple languages including Chinese, French, and Russian, underscores a universal plea: no ideology, no flag, no pride justifies the taking of life.</p>

  <p>From the silent streets of Kyiv to the snow-covered Carpathians, the song continues:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "We sing the names of peace,<br>
    Though war may overflow."
  </blockquote>

  <p>As global tensions rise and digital platforms transform music into another front of cultural warfare, I urge fellow artists, journalists, and listeners: do not betray the moral power of music. Raise your voice not in hatred, but in harmony. Let our songs stop wars, not start them.</p>

  <h2>Appendix: Song Excerpt (Lyrics Quoted)</h2>
  <blockquote>
    "From “She in the Fires of War”"<br><br>
    Fields of gold are gone,<br>
    Ashes whisper on the plain.<br>
    Children cry in dark,<br>
    Hiding deep from cold and flame.<br>
    No man should take a life,<br>
    Even dressed in iron pride.<br>
    History weeps in stone —<br>
    When shall we meet again?
